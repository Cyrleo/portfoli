## Overview

Development of a modern document management system built with Django, featuring AI-powered document indexing and intelligent search capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Smart Document Management**: Built a comprehensive system for storing, organizing and managing archives and contracts using Django's robust backend capabilities.
- **AI-Powered Indexing**: Integrated GitHub's model marketplace AI to automatically index and extract content from uploaded documents, enabling fast content discovery.
- **Advanced Search**: Implemented intelligent search functionality that allows users to quickly find documents based on content, metadata, and AI-generated tags.
- **Contract Lifecycle Management**: Developed features for managing the complete lifecycle of contracts including creation, review, approval, and archival processes.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: For building the complete web application backend and frontend
- **GitHub Model Marketplace AI**: For intelligent document content indexing
- **PostgreSQL**: For reliable document and metadata storage
- **Python**: Core programming language used throughout the project

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was implementing efficient document processing and indexing at scale. The solution involved optimizing the AI integration for batch processing and implementing caching strategies. Managing large document files while maintaining system performance required careful architecture planning and optimization of database queries.

## Outcome

The system successfully modernized document management processes by combining traditional archiving with AI capabilities. It significantly reduced time spent searching for documents and improved contract management efficiency through intelligent automation and organization.
